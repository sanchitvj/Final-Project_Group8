583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isn't a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up.

People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early you'd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because they're studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments.

I think it's better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if you're apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time.

Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits.

In conclusion i think it's best if people don't graduate early because they'd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe it's better and easier to graduate after the four years. ",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5

First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.

In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.

However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.

Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.

People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. What would be if all individuals make a bad impression the first time?",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5

5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students.

Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones' break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games' apps which include school knowlegdes.

However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted.

Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of people's views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students' business.

Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students.

Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones.

EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed

Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder.

The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math.

Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations.

The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.

In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents. ",5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5

Guiding other will make people believe in what you are saying and that will make you feel great because you are teaching other what you have been taught.

Sharing there thought will help people to doing great thing in there life even though life is not always perfect you will have to make the best out of it.

AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if you're self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you they're ugly how will you feel?

Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just don't want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I don't think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What l'm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person they're so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you don't if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until it's end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other can't do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person. Being kind to someone,helping people,and making people about you happy and it can also make you happy. why ,because you have a positive attitude and when you success in life you will be happy. The thing is when talking about positive attitude can be the key to success in life, is like you are talking about happiness is a wonderful thing that happen in a world and make people happy. So when saying key to success in life your talking about how you act ,respect,what you do?, and how will you success in it when your looking for positive attitude so that you can success. Their are not a lot people who have a positive attitude in this world,but their are people who are bringing positive attitude in this world. When you think about success in life do you think it would be great if everyone had the chance to be success in life ,but to be fair life is suppose to be hard that way we can learn from our mistakes. Positive attitude help you be success in life ,because we live we learn everyone is a learner in this world. Because no one is perfect or wonderful forever.",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

They are need to be disagree, because the school offer different kind the program to the student will be success on life. The school can provide us too, some career to start doing and learning what they want to be in the future. The bond more important in this life is the school, because can show us find our real self. The school can provide to be success on life, and can prepare to get better education.

The school provide us to be success on life on different way. The school is really good fundamental step, to teach us what the student want to be on the future and prepare for it. For example two year ago I meet a friend on Cuba who never went to school, he always been saying I dont want my expend my time on the school, when i can work and make really good money. For this moment is really good, because he dont has bill to pay, but after that he grow up. When he has to pay his own bill, and the money is not enough. So his Mon always been saying to him please Generic_Name go to the school, so one day he took the world to his Mon and for this he start to going to school again to the normal person. Generic_Name try to be success on the life and help his Mon what she need doing the right thing. So he never give up and he study hard to graduated. So he complete his goal and now he study doctor on the university, and making good money. This is a really good example to never give up and always need to follow our step no matter what.

The school can prepare the student to get more education . Basically the student past more time on the school than the house, its considered to us to the second house. The teacher teach to us what is the basic thing to respect each other and the main thing prepare us to the career that the student want to get in the future. The education the school bring to us are really important to find our self and to build our goal. Therefore the school is one of the main thing that was invented, because for this way the student can study the career that they want it. The school and the education the school bring always was been considerate the more important step on our life to create our way in the life

Some people may say to have home school is better because the teacher can explain to us most better. But they are wrong because the student can learn more doing the right on the school, can have more time with the teacher to do the homework etc. The school is really good please to find yourself making friend, playing sport. The student learn how to grow up with the person doing the right things. The always come to the school is a really good step to build the student future.

Basically I talked about "" Some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way online or video conference. The student who come to school the teacher can prepare most better to the future. The school is a really good bonds to us to choose what we want to do.

I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Name's team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play.

On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad.

9EC4A16802BF,"I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential.

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class.

Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills.

Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

B3F18E671DF2,"Do you think it is good decision to make school longer? When i was in my home country schools was only for six hours i disagree that schools extend two hours a day because the students will lost their focus, teachers will get tired from standing more than two hours, and some of the student will change their high school.

The student will lost their focus for example when i was in Afghanistan our school was from 8 to 12 and we where tired from listening to teachers. However, when i came to united state it was tough for many reason. for instance

When i came to united state it was so hard for me to get up at six and come home at two o clock. In addition if we have school ten hours of school each day the student and the people who work inside the school they all will get tired of school and student will not learn the teachers will get tired of teaching ten hours a day. Teachers will get tired of sanding for example they teach more than two hundred student a day so they will get tired and they teach for tomorrow. Once students get tired they will lost the focus form the teachers and they will start to talking with each other playing around the classroom or they will using their cell phones taxing their friends planning to skip their classes or panning to drop out of schools. The student will not get everything in their mind they will forget it for the next day. Maybe some student come to school and stay at school longer than seven hours a day but maybe some student cant stay longer than seven hours a day because maybe they work after school or maybe doing some think at home for example maybe they take cares of their little brothers or sisters or maybe they clean up the house. Teachers will get so tired because they will talking all day long explaining the chapter and students will not listening to them. Some students will change their schools because they doesnt want to be at schools more than six or seven hours a day. And also those who works in the schools it will be hard for them to clean up the schools the bad rooms or to cook food for students and than after that they have to wash ever think for next students that are coming after A lunch.

So will you just give up if you failed? and of course, people will judge you because you're not perfect. That's why Winston Churchill once said ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement. In life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.

To begin with, a lot of people thinks failure will only make you look bad and some thinks its the end of the world for them but that's not the case. Every each person make mistakes and having a motivation in your self will get your somewhere: however, when a person is lack of motivation in their life, they won't be as much successful and failure will take over.

Secondly, when it comes to hard times, a lot of people say that there's no point of trying if you're meant to be a failure. Every each person in this world know that they're capable of, and every each person know what their weakness are. However, having encouragement won't mean anything because if you're encourage enough, you will get back up and do anything you can to be successful.

At last, learning from your mistakes is the key to be successful. You will fail and fall but its very important that you get up and keep fighting because once failure takes over, it will be hard to get back up. Also you will need to earn the key to success, but once you find it, you will achieve anything in life not because you didn't give up but because your learn from your failure and mistake.

In conclusion, people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement and in life, you will fail a lot of time but it's important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.                ",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0
5A9C20C851FD,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldn't be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldn't attend they might be sleep, and they wouldn't care about the online classes.

The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students don't get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so that's why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path.

Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students don't has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldn't attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldn't learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesn't have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes.

Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they don't want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesn't work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldn't have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school.

I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldn't attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesn't have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesn't have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, that's one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit.

In conclusion,

however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning, because that wouldn't be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldn't learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach.

I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldn't be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them.

E545B850725F,"Although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it's a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here's why.

The students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how.

Opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one.

Other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work.

The extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if it's a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.         ",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5

78EA0C3715FE,"In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.

I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.

I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.

There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.

Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.

This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.

In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0
113B1543C433,"If School programs offer

Student to graduate early instead of waiting the four year to graduate. Graduating a year earlier would be a great thing for student to do because there are people who are trying to manage work and school but it's difficult for some people because they can't do both, If they work and they come late after work and the next morning they wake up tired from work that they are tired to go to school and it makes it difficult to go to work and then go to school.

A reason why I feel students should graduate early is because if they graduate early they can go to college, and if college allows them to choose their hours they can decide on what time they can go to college or the days.

It could also depend on what you want to do career wise.

If they allow that you can work and go to college and it would make it easier for you and you won't feel tired after college to go to work.

For example,My mom graduated early and she was able to work and and go to college as well.

Another reason is that if you go to high school and work its difficult because you have to worry about school and work, sometimes thats a problem because when you come late from work and in the morning when you have to go into school your tired and you dont wanna go to school and your tired and you can't concentrate in school but I feel like when your in college you can choose your time and date and it makes it easier for you.

For Example, I have a friend who works and goes to school to and he tells me its difficult for him to manage school and work and sometimes hes even tired to go to school. Even when hes at school hes tired and can't do any of his work because hes tired and its hard for him to concentrate.

The last reason is if people were to graduate a year earlier from high school. They can also go to college and depending on on what they want in their career, they could also graduate college early and start you career early

For Example, My Uncle graduated High school earlier and he also graduated college which made it easier for him to start his own business and it really helped him out in life and hes really happy because he graduated early.

If you choose to graduate and do classes in the summer you would feel accomplished and you would feel relief you wont have to be there for 4 years and only 3 years.

If you finish early you can have time for work and college and also you get start your career early and you would feel happy with what you have accomplished. ",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5
80E36876B2CB,"No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.

Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. She's in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain.

Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.

Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didn't used to hurt like it used to before all the time, that's why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but it's good for their health.

Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.

C3429FEF8AEE,"I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes.

One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my country's weather not to cold weather.

Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days.

However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break,

a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter if you have any questions let me know and I will happy to talk about this matter.

Sencerely,

If you are honest it can get you in less troubel when you tell the truth and not lie. When you are homest it gives you a good reputaion that what it gives you when you are not honest. When you tell people the truth people trust you more.

When you are honest with people they trust you more and that make you someone who they can always talk to and you should be proud of yourself. If someone was ever dishonest with you would you want to have someone in your life that lies to you? You wont be able to tell them anything because they are not trustworthly . When you are honest more people want to be your friend because people like someone who is honest and wont lie.

When you dont lie to people it gives you a good reputaion because you are being honest. When you are honest to your teacher friends famlies when ever you do someithing they can belive you because they trust you that you are teeling them the truth and not lieing to them. People might know you as a honest person. When you are dishonest it afects your reputation

When you are honest it can get you in less trouble. In school being honest can get you in less trouble than what you would get when you lie. With your parents it gets you in less touble when you tell the truth because they dont like it when you lie. can trust you when you go out.

3DFE1FE3FCE8,"Success is the most important thing in this world. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with him Because failure played a important role to be a success. Success is when people do hard work to get what they want to get from their lives. Most people want their success in school and to a dream job.

Graduating from school is the big achievement because for some people its hard to pass sol's or exam. They study hard to pass that class so they can graduate from school. Like if someone came from another country and that person does not know how to speak English. That person might fail all of the classes like English, history, and science. That person will try their best but they might not get on the first time and they will keep try until they get what they want. If some student fail there test from that failure that student know how they can fix in the next test or how they can be better then the last test. They can be more prepared.

A lot people find a job which they like to do but some people does not get their dream jobs. And some people never give up. One person who want to be a dancer but his dad does not support him. He never give up to convince his father but still his father does not listen to him. He leave his house to be dancer but after leaving the house he has nothing, he don't even have money to pay for his school, but still he never give up. He started his know dance workshop where he get money so he can pay for his school. Now he is the one of the best dance choreographer in India Remo Dsoza. When people went for job interview some people get the job on the first time. But some people have to work hard until they got the job too. They work on how they can be better next time so they can get the job.

In conclusion, success is the thing which everyone wants but they are not going to get it give they did not work hard. To became a successful people have to learn from their mistakes. Failure is the key of success because if people are not going to fail they can't be better next time. In this world people who are successful in their lives right now they also have failures in their live too. To become Successful people have to learn from their failure.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0

People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. and our population will decrease because of technology.

In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. we as people should stand up for each other. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other.

EA8BE9778AA9,"On a human, the brain is the strongest part of their body. It control your body. Also, world's one of the biggest thing from a human brain is imagination. More than 100 years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. Most of the things were build my their own imagination. Our world's one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways.

""Imagination""

is the power of mind to make something creative. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didn't thought of. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine.

Also It helps your mind get stronger. When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it's making your brain stronger everyday.

Imaginary can make you an open minded person. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger. And that way you will be able to help others'    ",3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future.

65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.

First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.

Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.

Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.

In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",4.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0
